<header class="header"><!--A header was placed here to contain the links used for navigation.
                            This keeps those links at the top of the screen to aid in usability. It was given a class
                            so that a background could be added to all links in the header at the appropriate size,
                            as specified in the stylesheet.-->
    <nav>
        <!--The nav tag holds all the links for navigation. The advantage of this tag over using div is that it's read
        as a way to navigate the websites by assistive technologies. Within this tag are anchor tags that are used to
        link to other pages in the website, specified by the href attribute which specifies the path to the page to be
        displayed when the link is clicked. What is displayed on the page is between the anchor tags and specified by
        the wireframe.
          The span tag allows the use of other class and id's within an element that already has one. In this case
        this allowed me to tag this link as the one that would be highlighted as the current page allowing me to add
        styling for that aspect of the design. Whilst also keeping the links class that allowed me to add the same
        styling as the other links to this link as well. -->

<h1>Museum of Odds &amp; Ends</h1><!--
                                   As these are just titles, a heading tag was all that was necessary. As it was
                                   the main title it was given a H1 tag whilst the subtitle below was only given an
                                   H2 tag to create a smaller subheading for the page below the header.
                                  -->
<h2>Walton Hall, Milton Keynes</h2>
<div class="container">
    <!--
     A generic container was used to house the images and their links on the page. By using this I was able to more
     easily place all six images with their links on the page using css and keep them all appropriately positioned
     relative to each other as instead of six separate elements, it is condensed into one.
         For the images themselves, I used the figure tag as this combines content with a caption underneath.
     This allowed me to place captions underneath the image and have both the image and caption treated as one
     element.
         As it was requested that both the image and the caption linked to the same url, they both started with
     anchor tags, explained above, nested inside was the img tag, with the path to the image given in the src
     attribute, and alt text given by the alt attribute, to improve accessibility as the alt text would be read by
     screen readers for those with difficulty seeing. It also improves useability as it displays the alt text if the
     image can't be loaded. The width and height attributes specifies the width and height of the image, ensuring
     they are all uniform on the website.
         The figcaption tag specifies that the contents are the caption for, in this case, the image. Again
     they were nested in anchor tags, and given that the styling was specified to be different from that usually given
     to links by the anchor tag, they were given a class so that these changes could be made.

    <!--
         A div is placed here with a class to contain the whole news section of the webpage, making it easier to
     position and style. Within the div is another div that contains the individual news title date and entry. This is
     so that I can individually create a 15 pixel gap between news items as specified in the style sheet. Headings
     are used to style the titles, the main title of news uses heading 1 as it is the most important title, with news
     title and date using heading 2 and 3 respectively. A paragraph tag is used for the news entry, and with no other
     styling required it is left as is.
